Installation
============

For the moment cd to the top level ``GPry`` folder (the outer one, not the ``gpry`` one). There run::

    $ pip install . 

This should (hopefully) install the package. Note that you need `NumPy <https://numpy.org/>`_ and `Scikit-Learn <https://scikit-learn.org/stable/>`_
as dependencies.

This will be changed later but for now this should work just fine.
